    "score": 65,
    "comments": "The module output demonstrates moderate comprehensiveness by including 20+ articles related to China's National Games, with relevant titles highlighting regional collaboration, athlete performances, and official perspectives. However, significant issues include: 1) Inclusion of irrelevant content (e.g., U.S. college sports, Kenya safari lawsuit, gaming recruitment), 2) Repetitive entries ('...Long Guides Beijing...' appears twice), 3) Language inconsistency mixing Chinese and English titles, 4) Missing key aspects like detailed event results or athlete statistics. While the core topic is addressed, noise and redundancy reduce overall quality."

  "article_cleaner": {
    "score": 85,
    "comments": "The module effectively removes HTML tags and most special characters, preserving core content. However, some irrelevant content (e.g., photo captions) and incomplete sentences remain, and minor formatting inconsistencies exist. Overall, it meets the core requirement but has room for refinement."

  "deduplicator": {
    "score": 65,
    "comments": "The module partially fulfills the requirement by removing some obvious duplicates but fails to address content similarity comprehensively. Key issues include: 1) Retained near-duplicates (e.g., '...Long Guides Beijing...' appears twice in output), 2) Inconsistent handling of multilingual content, 3) No clear similarity threshold for titles like 'National Games' variants. Strengths include removal of exact duplicates and preservation of diverse topics. Improvements needed in similarity algorithms and multilingual processing."

  "entity_extractor": {
    "score": 65,
    "comments": "The module successfully extracted key entities but has significant omissions. Strengths: Correctly identified major locations (China, Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao, Shenzhen), organizations (Xinhua, National Games), and some people (Wang Haoming, John Lee) with accurate counts. Weaknesses: Missed important people like Timothy Fok Tsun-ting, Su Bingtian, Ma Long, Chester King, Li Chunyu, Zhou Chang, Dong Yixing; missed organizations like Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, UConn, San Diego State, British Esports; missed locations like Zhuhai, United Kingdom, United States. The entity categorization is appropriate but incomplete extraction reduces effectiveness."

  "summarizer": {
    "score": 88,
    "comments": "The summary effectively captures the core theme of China's 15th National Games as a historic cross-boundary event promoting Greater Bay Area integration. It successfully synthesizes key elements from multiple articles including the collaborative hosting by Guangdong/Hong Kong/Macao, regional significance, cultural aspects of the closing ceremony, and notable athlete performances. The summary maintains strong coherence by properly distinguishing between main National Games content and peripheral sports news. Minor deduction for not explicitly mentioning some article titles in the synthesis and occasional timeline inconsistencies (some articles reference 2021/2023 while summary focuses on 2025). Overall, it provides a comprehensive, well-structured overview that fulfills the requirement for concise topic summarization."
