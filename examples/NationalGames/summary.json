  "summary": "China's 15th National Games concluded on November 21, 2025, marking a historic milestone as the first edition jointly hosted by Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao. This cross-boundary collaboration underscored the event's role in fostering regional integration within the Greater Bay Area. The closing ceremony, held at Shenzhen's Happy Theater, featured a technologically advanced water-stage performance blending Lingnan cultural motifs.\n\nKey figures emphasized the Games' broader significance. Timothy Fok Tsun-ting, President of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, highlighted sports as a bridge for regional cohesion. Hong Kong SAR Chief Executive John Lee commended local athletes for their performances, noting the event's success in promoting unity post-Hong Kong's return to China.\n\nThe Games also served as a platform for emerging talent, with teenagers like 18-year-old Zhang Zhans showcasing potential for future Olympic cycles. The event coincided with the retirement of sprint legend Su Bingtian, symbolizing a transition in Chinese athletics.\n\nWhile the coverage primarily focused on the National Games, unrelated international sports news, such as the 2023 NCAA March Madness finale between UConn and San Diego State, and local events like the Guangzhou International Gourmet Festival, were briefly mentioned but did not detract from the central narrative of regional collaboration and athletic development in China.",
