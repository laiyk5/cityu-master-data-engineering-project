    "score": 85,
    "comments": "The module output demonstrates strong comprehensiveness by including 20 diverse articles from multiple sources, covering key aspects like export policies, market impact, and competitor responses related to the Nvidia H20 GPU topic. However, some titles appear redundant or slightly off-topic (e.g., Alibaba's AI processor), and there is no direct inclusion of technical specifications or broader industry context. Overall, it effectively meets the requirement with minor room for refinement in relevance and depth."

  "article_cleaner": {
    "score": 85,
    "comments": "Module successfully removes HTML tags and special characters while preserving meaningful content. Handles 'No Content' entries appropriately by filtering them out. Good text normalization with consistent punctuation handling. Minor issues include occasional inconsistent spacing after commas and potential over-aggressive punctuation removal in some technical contexts. Overall performs core cleaning functions effectively."
  },
  "deduplicator": {
    "score": 40,
    "comments": "The module demonstrates basic deduplication by removing some obvious duplicates (e.g., identical Chinese titles), but it fails to address content similarity across languages and key topics. Critical English articles about NVIDIA H20/H200 GPUs and US-China trade dynamics are incorrectly removed, while redundant Chinese titles like the duplicated 'H200芯片若重返中国市场影响几何' are retained. The output lacks semantic understanding and preserves formatting errors (e.g., missing '%' symbols). Overall, the deduplication is inconsistent and incomplete."

  "entity_extractor": {
    "score": 65,
    "comments": "The module correctly identified key organizations (Nvidia, Alibaba Cloud) and locations (China, Chinese market) with accurate counts, showing good extraction capability. However, it missed important entities like 'Trump administration', 'Huawei', 'RAND', and 'Ascend 910B', and failed to extract any people or dates despite their presence in the text. The summary accurately reflects the extracted data but is incomplete due to missed entities. Improvements are needed in entity coverage and granularity."
  },
  "summarizer": {
    "score": 92,
    "comments": "The summary provides a comprehensive analysis covering the potential H200 approval, technical specifications, market context, competitive landscape, and domestic innovations. It effectively synthesizes information from multiple articles while maintaining conciseness. Strengths include clear structure, technical accuracy, and balanced coverage of opportunities/challenges. Minor improvements could include more direct attribution to source articles and slightly tighter phrasing in some sections. Overall, it successfully meets the requirement for a concise yet informative summary of the complex topic."
