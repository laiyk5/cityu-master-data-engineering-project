  "data_fetcher": {
    "score": 85,
    "comments": "The module demonstrates strong comprehensiveness with 22 diverse articles covering multiple angles (legal, political, survivor perspectives, media reactions) and sources. However, some titles contain grammatical errors and lack clear source attribution, slightly affecting credibility. Overall, it successfully captures the breadth of the Trump-Epstein topic while maintaining relevance."

  "article_cleaner": {
    "score": 85,
    "comments": "Module performs well at HTML tag removal and basic cleaning, successfully stripping paragraph tags while preserving quoted content. However, it fails to remove 'No Content' entries and doesn't properly handle spacing issues in concatenated words like 'Trumpthen' and 'Epsteindocuments'. The module maintains relevant content but could be improved with better special character handling and content filtering."
  },
  "deduplicator": {
    "score": 75,
    "comments": "The module successfully removed some obvious duplicates but missed several similar articles, particularly those with minor variations in wording. It performed well on exact duplicates but showed limitations in semantic similarity detection. Key issues include: retained 'Trump signs bill demanding his administration release the Epstein files' while removing similar variants, missed content-similar pairs like 'Why Trump can never win on Epstein' and 'Could Trump destroy the Epstein files?', and failed to recognize semantically equivalent articles about congressional actions. The deduplication logic appears to rely heavily on exact string matching rather than comprehensive content similarity analysis."

  "entity_extractor": {
    "score": 78,
    "comments": "The module successfully identified key people (Trump, Epstein, Bill Clinton) and organizations (House, Congress, DOJ) with accurate frequency counts, demonstrating solid entity recognition. However, it missed several important entities including Pam Bondi, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, and Maxwell, and failed to recognize locations like 'house' in contextual references. The organizational extraction could be improved by consolidating aliases (DOJ/Justice Department) and the complete absence of location extraction is a significant gap. Overall, the module performs adequately for basic entity extraction but requires refinement for comprehensive coverage."
  },
  "summarizer": {
    "score": 85,
    "comments": "The summary effectively captures the bipartisan congressional action compelling Epstein document release, Trump's role in signing the legislation, and the political context including email revelations and Trump's denials. It successfully synthesizes multiple article angles into a coherent narrative with key details like voting margins (427-1) and the 30-day release timeline. However, it could be more concise by reducing some redundant phrasing and could more explicitly connect all article titles to the summary content. The summary maintains objectivity while covering the political dynamics and consequences."
