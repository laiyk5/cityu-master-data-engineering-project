  "summary": "A bipartisan congressional effort has culminated in legislation compelling the full release of documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Following initial resistance, former President Donald Trump signed the bill, which mandates Attorney General Pam Bondi to release all unclassified Justice Department records, communications, and investigative materials concerning Epstein within 30 days.\n\nThe legislative action gained overwhelming support, with the House of Representatives passing the measure 427-1 and the Senate following suit, reflecting rare cross-party consensus. This development occurred alongside the release of emails by House Democrats in which Epstein made claims about Trump, alleging he \"spent hours at my house\" and \"knew about the girls.\" Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing, stating he had a falling out with the convicted sex offender years before his presidency.\n\nIn response, Trump directed the Justice Department to investigate prominent Democrats mentioned in the files, including former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. The DOJ confirmed it had already turned over tens of thousands of pages of documents. The situation has led to a former official announcing their departure from public roles, underscoring the scandal's widening impact as both parties pursue transparency and accountability regarding associations with Epstein.",
